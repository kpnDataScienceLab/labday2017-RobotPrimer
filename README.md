Implementing a chatbot within the Robot Operating System

## Goals

Inspired by the ROS Robotics Projects by Lentin Joseph and the [code](https://github.com/qboticslabs/ros_robotics_projects) therein, we are going to:
* Implement a Siri-Like chatbot
* Have two chatbots talk with each other
And if we still have time:
* Add image recognition capabilities to it via DeepLearning and TensorFlow
* Show the robot an object and have him tell some anedoctal stories about it 

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Python 2.7
* PyAIML: AIMLinterpreter in Python
* [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)
* The sound_play ROS package: text-to-speech package in ROS
* TensorFlow (0.11.0rc1, not working with TF1.0 see [here](https://github.com/qboticslabs/ros_robotics_projects/issues/4))
* OpenCV, cv-bridge and cv-camera
